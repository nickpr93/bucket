            <h1>Bucket</h1>
            <p>Bucket aims to be a social platform with the functionality of Uber, lowering the barriers to entry in philanthropic engagement. The focus of Bucket is to counteract America’s food waste epidemic, with 130 billion pounds of food going to waste in a country in which 49.1 million Americans live in food insecure households. Bucket looks to partner with supermarkets and restaurants in developing a pick-up/drop-off system that would be powered by the average citizen; the Bucket app would alert to pick-up opportunities during your routine run to the market or drive home and then point you towards the nearest food bank/designated drop-off point. The low-cost to engagement, an individual’s drop in the Bucket, will increase the likelihood of mass adoption and, hopefully, substantial change.</p>

            <h1>The Product</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Bucket will be an iOS and Android application, downloadable for free. The interface will be sleek and intuitive, designed to meet the standard of modern apps. The central functionality of the app is that it will be able to detect drop-off and pick-up opportunities in real time, and allow users to claim these opportunities accurately. Another of the key features, to ensure the sustained success the product, will be a seamless connection to social media and a captivating rewards system. The former would allow our user to share their philanthropic actions with their friends and followers, a method that has been proven to increase the app’s chances of going viral.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The latter is even more important. Every delivery or pickup made will add a drop to the user’s personal “bucket”. As the user fills up the bucket, they will be rewarded with gift cards and prizes donated by corporate sponsors. For example, on their 10th “drop”, the user would receive a $5 dollar gift card from Starbucks. When that goal is reached, what was initially a small bucket on their screen will turn into a bathtub. This mechanism will ensure continued involvement and would be crucial to our business strategy, as we predict that sponsors would line up to be a part of this venture.</p>

            <h1>The Future</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Over the course of this year we plan to develop Bucket in full, and release a user-ready version by next fall. This application would include all features listed above, focusing specifically on the interactive map and the rewards system. Before release Bucket must be easy to operate and primarily bug free, which is why we plan to spend as much time as needed to develop the platform.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Bucket has huge potential for growth. Though it is starting out as an app to solve the food waste crisis in the United States, the possibilities for future charitable ventures are endless. Making full use of the user rewards system, Bucket can continue to lower the barriers to entry to other nonprofits. In the next five years we hope to add a function that allows users to view all humanitarian efforts in their geographical area, including fundraisers, volunteer opportunities and more. Participating in these events will add more drops to the user’s individual bucket, incentivising philanthropy throughout. </p>
